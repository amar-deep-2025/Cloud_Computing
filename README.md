Q.1 What is Cloud Computing ?
ANS: Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services-  such as servers, storage, networking, software and analytics.

Key Points:
1) On-demand-Access : You can access services anytinme form anywhere over the internet.

2) Pay-as-you-go : You only pay for what you use, reducing upfront costs.

3) Scalable : You can increase or decrease resources based on your needs.

4) Manage by providers : No need to maintain physical server or infrastructure. 

# Types of Computing 
1) Iaas(Infrastructure as a Service) : Iaas contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. it typically provides access to networking features, computers(virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.Iaas provides the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.
Ex:- Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute cloud)

2) PaaS(Platform as a Service) : PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your application. This helps you be more efficient as you don't need to worry about resources procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running you application. 
Ex:-Heroku etc..

3) SaaS(Software as a Service) : SaaS provides you with a complete  product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring  to end-user-applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering , you have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.
Ex:-Gmail, Google Sheets, Zoom, Google meet etc..

# Different Types of Cloud Deployment

1) PUBLIC CLOUD :   A shared cloud environment where multiple users access services over the internet, like AWS, or Azure.

2) PRIVATE CLOUD : A dedicated cloud environment for one organization, offering more control and privacy.

3) HYBRID CLOUD : A mix of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility.


# Few Features Commonly Offered By Cloud Providers

1) Networking Services
2) Compute Services
3) Database Services
4) Machine Learning Services
5) API Management 
etc..

# What is AWS ?
